Wisconsin Healthcare-Associated Infections in LTC Coalition
1. Developing Role of Medical Director
 1974-Medicare said "The Medical Director should be responsible for the medical care of the residents of the facility."

 1987-OBRA

March 1991, AMDA

approves "Roles and Responsibilities of the

Medical Director in Nursing Homes."

19

Wisconsin Healthcare-Associated Infections in LTC Coalition
1. Developing Role of Medical Director
 2001 Institute of Medicine report-"Improving Quality of Long Term Care" urged facilities to give Medical Directors greater authority and accountability.
 Also, NH should develop structure and policy to "enable and require" a more focused and dedicated staff through credentialing, peer review, and accountability to the Medical Director.
 April 2002 AMDA revises 1991 "Roles and Responsibilities..." to clarify Medical Director's oversight of care to the increasingly complex, frail and medically challenging nursing home population. (This revised in 2011*)
* AMDA White Paper A-11 20

01/03/2018
Wisconsin Healthcare-Associated Infections in LTC Coalition
Medical Director's Role F-Tag 501
 "The Medical Director helps the facility identify, evaluate and address /resolve medical and clinical concerns and issues that affect resident care or quality of life related to provisions of services by physicians and other licensed health care providers"
 This oversight, consultative, administrative function is distinctly separate from his clinical care of his personal residents in the facility.
S&C 5-29 June 5, 2005
21
Wisconsin Healthcare-Associated Infections in LTC Coalition
Compliance with F-501
 There must be a Medical Director who is a licensed physician
 The survey team must identify whether noncompliance at other tags relates to the Medical Director Role.
 The team must show association between the identified deficiency and failure in medical direction.
 This does not presume that a facility's noncompliance...necessarily reflects on the performance of the Medical Director.
